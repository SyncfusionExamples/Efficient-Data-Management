Efficient Data Management: Implementing Row Drag and Drop with Data Grid as Detail Template in Tree Grid.

This sample explores row drag and drop functionality within the data grid as a detail template of the tree grid. By default, support for row drag and drop between one-to-many and vice versa is not available. However, we have achieved this functionality by utilizing the RowDragStarting event of the grid and handling drag and drop operations in JavaScript using Microsoft.JsInterop.

# How to run
* Open the sample in Visual Studio
* Add the dependencies to the application
* Compile and run the application
